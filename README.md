# Item Duplicator

## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. It allows duplication of single Items, duplicating all metadata and, optionally, tags, but not the files (basically, allows to use an existing Item as a template for similar ones).

Settings allow to choose who can duplicate Items, and whether Tags or some fields (like Title and Data) should be emptied when duplicating, in order to not create a copycat of the original Item.

## Warning / disclaimer

Plugin is still under construction, to work it needs a change to core files; please refer to https://forum.omeka.org/t/duplicate-an-item/4694 for more info. Contributes and pull requests are always welcome.
