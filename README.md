# Item Duplicator

## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. It allows duplication of single Items, duplicating all metadata and, optionally, tags, but not the files (basically, allows to use an existing Item as a template for similar ones).

Settings allow to choose who can duplicate Items, and whether Tags or some fields (like Title and Data) should be emptied when duplicating, in order to not create a copycat of the original Item.

## Installation

Copy the files to the plugins directory, and install from the Omeka plugins page
