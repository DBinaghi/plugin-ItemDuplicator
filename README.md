# Item Duplicator

## Description
Omeka Classic plugin that allows to duplicate single items.

Duplicate item can inherit everything (but the files) from original item, or tags and key fields (DC:Title, DC:Subject and DC:Date) can be blanked out (and empty fields can be highlighted).

Normally whoever has got editing rights on a particular item can also duplicate it; an option is available to limit function only to Admin and Super User roles.

Last option allows to keep private the duplicate item, useful for editor roles to double check item before publishing.

## Installation
Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "ItemDuplicator".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
